# Snort-IDS-Logging-Suspicious-Traffic

Overview:

Snort is a powerful network intrusion detection system that can monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activity based on a set of rules. This project focuses on setting up Snort to log suspicious traffic using Nmap scans.
I used only IDS to monitor and log the any suspicious traffic using snort (incline mode disabled )
The rules used in config file are already pre configured I did not add any new rules to snort.conf file.

Take a look demo video for more understanding !!



Features
1) Real-time monitoring of network traffic.

2) Detection of common attacks (e.g., Nmap scans, SYN floods, etc.).

3) Logging of suspicious traffic to a file.

4) Customizable rules for specific use cases.
